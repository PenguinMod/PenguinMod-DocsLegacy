# PenguinGPT
PenguinGPT is extension created by [Anonymous-cat1](https://github.com/Anonymous-cat1/WorkingTurboGPT). But then fixed and improved buy [RubyDevs](https://rubydevs.tech/).

# Info:

In 19th january when RubyDevs made updated version, original creator swithed all files to RubyDevs version resulting errors in all gpt projects that was using that extension. RubyDevs also made proxy so you can still use old version just by putting new proxy inside(new version of extension reccomended)!
# Here is quick tutorial for this extension:
