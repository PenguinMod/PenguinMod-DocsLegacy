# PenguinGPT
PenguinGPT is extension created by [Anonymous-cat1](https://github.com/Anonymous-cat1/WorkingTurboGPT). But then fixed and improved buy [RubyDevs](https://rubydevs.tech/).

# Info:

In 19th january when RubyDevs made updated version, original creator swithed all files to RubyDevs version resulting errors in all gpt projects that was using that extension. RubyDevs also made proxy so you can still use old version just by putting new proxy inside(new version of extension reccomended)!
# Here is quick tutorial for this extension:
# Set Reverse Proxy Block
First start all with setting reverse proxy! I reccomend using this reverse proxy shown on picture:

![set reverse block](../images/blocks/extensions/PenguinGPT/setreverse.png)
This block sets proxy through which will requests to gpt go.
# Is Reverse Proxy Working
This block checks if proxy you set is working.

![check proxy](../images/blocks/extensions/PenguinGPT/isreverseworking.png)
Block returns value of ``true`` or ``false``.
