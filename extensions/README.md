# Extensions

Extensions are the main feature in PenguinMod, which is _mostly_ where all the new blocks are created.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Deprecation</mark>

Sometimes extensions get deprecated, this may be because:

* The blocks have been made core blocks
* The blocks have no use

When a extension is deprecated, it will be removed from the extension menu and when you open up a project containing a deprecated extension a warning message will appear.
